This is my second commercial project for little start up named BullPad.

Later this application will be as Launchpad and marketplace to sell and buy different tokens and NFT's.

Currently this is a just a test app with fake data. Soon it will be full-fledged working project. This page has been adapted to different devices.

User technologies: React, Redux, React-hook-form, React-router-dom, React-redux, redux-thunk, HTML, SASS(SCSS), JavaScript.

Currently app is installed on the server, but hosting isn't connected.

P.S.
I developed the design myself, based on the customer's wishes.

Use "npm install" to download necessary modules.

Then "npm start" and your app will be launched in the Browser.
